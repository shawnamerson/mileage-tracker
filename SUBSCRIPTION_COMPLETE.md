## 🚀 Next Steps: Complete Setup

### Step 1: Add RevenueCat API Key

1. Follow the instructions in **`REVENUECAT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** to:
   - Create RevenueCat account
   - Set up App Store Connect subscriptions
   - Configure RevenueCat products

2. Once you have your RevenueCat iOS API Key, add it to `.env`:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY=appl_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. Restart your Expo dev server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

---

## 📋 How It Works

### For New Users

1. **Sign Up** → Creates account + starts 14-day trial
2. **Onboarding** → Sets up vehicle info
3. **Use App** → Full access to all features during trial
4. **Day 14** → Trial expires → Paywall appears
5. **Subscribe** → Unlocks permanent access

### For Existing Users

1. **Sign In** → Loads account
2. **Check Trial** → If expired → Paywall
3. **Subscribe or Restore** → Unlocks access

### Trial & Subscription Logic

```
Trial Active (Days 1-14) → Full Access
Trial Expired + No Subscription → Paywall (blocks app)
Active Subscription → Full Access
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Subscription Flow

### Using Sandbox Testing (Without RevenueCat Setup)

Right now, without your RevenueCat key configured, the app will:
- ✅ Allow sign-up with 14-day trial
- ✅ Show trial days remaining in Settings
- ✅ Allow full app access during trial
- ❌ Paywall will show "No subscription options" (needs RevenueCat)

### Once RevenueCat is Configured

1. **Create a sandbox test account** in App Store Connect
2. **Test the flow:**
   - Sign up → see 14-day trial start
   - Go to Settings → see "X days remaining"
   - Wait or manually expire trial in Supabase
   - App redirects to paywall
   - Test subscription purchase (uses sandbox account)
   - Test restore purchases

---

## 🔧 Manual Trial Expiration (For Testing)

To test the paywall without waiting 14 days:

### Option 1: Update Supabase Profile

1. Go to Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → `profiles`
2. Find your user
3. Update `trial_ends_at` to a past date (e.g., yesterday)
4. Restart app → paywall should appear

### Option 2: SQL Query

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET trial_ends_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

   - Validates purchases
   - Manages subscriptions
   - Handles renewals

2. **Supabase profiles table**
   - `trial_started_at` - When trial began
   - `trial_ends_at` - When trial expires
   - `subscription_status` - 'trial', 'active', 'expired', 'cancelled'
   - `subscription_expires_at` - When subscription expires

### How Sync Works

```
User Subscribes → RevenueCat validates → Updates Supabase profile
App checks: RevenueCat OR Supabase to determine access
```

---

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Receipt validation by RevenueCat
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Row-level security in Supabase
